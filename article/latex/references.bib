abstract = {The last 20 years have seen ever-increasing research activity in the field of human activity recognition. With activity recognition having considerably matured, so has the number of challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating activity recognition systems. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive hands-on introduction for newcomers to the field of human activity recognition. It specifically focuses on activity recognition using on-body inertial sensors. We first discuss the key research challenges that human activity recognition shares with general pattern recognition and identify those challenges that are specific to human activity recognition. We then describe the concept of an Activity Recognition Chain (ARC) as a general-purpose framework for designing and evaluating activity recognition systems. We detail each component of the framework, provide references to related research, and introduce the best practice methods developed by the activity recognition research community. We
conclude with the educational example problem of recognizing different hand gestures from inertial sensors attached to the upper and lower arm. We illustrate how each component of this framework can be implemented for this specific activity recognition problem and demonstrate how different implementations compare and how they impact overall recognition performance.},

abstract = {Information about the motor performance, i.e. how well an activity is performed, is valuable information for a variety of novel applications in Activity Recognition (AR). Its as- sessment represents a significant challenge, as requirements depend on the specific application. We develop an approach to quantify one aspect that many domains share – the ef- ficiency of motion – that has implications for signals from body-worn or pervasive sensors, as it influences the inherent complexity of the recorded multi-variate time-series. Based on the energy distribution in PCA we infer a single, nor- malised metric that is intimately linked to signal complexity and allows comparison of (subject-specific) time-series. We evaluate the approach on artificially distorted signals and apply it to a simple kitchen task to show its applicability to real-life data streams.},

@article{Davids2003,
abstract = {In recent years, concepts and tools from dynamical systems theory have been successfully applied to the study of movement systems, contradicting traditional views of variability as noise or error. From this perspective, it is apparent that variability in movement systems is omnipresent and unavoidable due to the distinct constraints that shape each individual’s behaviour. In this position paper, it is argued that trial-to-trial movement variations within individuals and perform- ance differences observed between individuals may be best interpreted as attempts to exploit the variability that is inherent within and between biological systems. That is, variability in movement systems helps individuals adapt to the unique constraints (personal, task and environmental) impinging on them across different timescales. We examine the implications of these ideas for sports medicine, by: (i) focusing on intra-individual variability in postural control to exemplify within-individual real-time adaptations to
changing informational constraints in the performance environment; and (ii) interpreting recent evidence on the role of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene as a genetic (developmental) constraint on individual differences in physical performance. The implementation of a dynamical systems theoretical interpretation of variability in movement systems signals a need to re-evaluate the ubiquitous influence of the traditional ‘medical model’ in interpreting motor behaviour and performance constrained by disease or injury to the movement system. Accord- ingly, there is a need to develop new tools for providing individualised plots of motor behaviour and performance as a function of key constraints. Coordination profiling is proposed as one such alternative approach for interpreting the variabil- ity and stability demonstrated by individuals as they attempt to construct function- al, goal-directed patterns of motor behaviour during each unique performance. Finally, the relative contribution of genes and training
to between-individual performance variation is highlighted, with the conclusion that dynamical systems theory provides an appropriate multidisciplinary theoretical framework to explain their interaction in supporting physical performance.},

@article{Ahmadi2010,
abstract = {In this article, the possibility of using wearable gyroscope sensors for skill assessment and skill acquisition was investigated. Marker-based methods were used initially to capture the fast rotational motions and simulate the outputs of gyroscope sensors. Utilizing the marker-based methods, the angular velocity of the upper arm internal rotation, wrist flexion, and shoulder rotation were calculated for a range of athletes using the trajectory of Vicon markers with respect to the Plug-in Gait model during the first serve in tennis. Participants from amateur to elite participated in this study. Thirty successful serves from each participant were assessed. The results showed that the peak values of the upper arm internal rotation, wrist flexion, and shoulder rotation just before impact are indicative in classifying the participants’ skill level. It was shown that all the three parameters, as well as the racquet head speed, increased as the level of proficiency of the participants increased. A line (
R250.89) was fitted to the scatter data containing the upper arm internal rotation, wrist flexion, and racquet head speed. The fit line is a function of upper armrotation and wrist flexion. The fit line can be used as a potential skill acquisition tool to provide feedback on which variables (upper arm internal rotation, wrist flexion, or shoulder rotation) need to be improved. The positions of three gyroscope sensors to detect the same trends as those from the marker-based methods were determined. Therefore, it is envisaged that gyroscope sensors could be used for skill assessment and skill acquisition for a first tennis serve.},

Skilled street dancers and nondancers were required to synchronize a knee-bending movement in a standing position to a metronome beat. The dancer group showed significantly smaller variability of temporal deviation (defined as the peak knee-flexion time minus beat onset time), and lower level of muscle cocontraction analyzed by electromyographic data of the agonist and antagonist muscles of the upper and lower leg than did the nondancer group. In addition, multiple regression analyses revealed that the group effect significantly predicted the level of muscle cocontraction. These results show that the level of muscle cocontraction in the lower limbs during whole-body sensorimotor synchronization movement is associated with the degree of proficiency of the
movement.},

abstract = {Documentation that dancers have better balance abilities than nondancers is important because of the number of dancers who sustain injury and then are referred to physical therapists for treatment. The purpose of this study was to compare balance abilities of professional dancers with nondancers on selected balance conditions. Fifteen dancers and 15 age- and gender-matched nondancers maintained one-legged stance under six combinations of visual and support surface conditions (Foam and Dome Test modified from two feet to one foot). Each condition was maintained for 30 seconds. A composite balance score was obtained for each subject by summing the number of seconds the individual maintained balance for each test condition. There was a significant difference in the mean composite balance score (across the six balance conditions) for the dance group compared with the control group (731 seconds and 563 seconds, respectively). Under sensory challenged conditions, it appeared that dancers were better
able to maintain their postures upright against gravity. The balance strategies and techniques learned by professional dancers should be carefully analyzed to determine if they could be incorporated into treatment programs for nondancers who have balance instability and dancers who are injured.},

Objective measurement of the accuracy in position-matching at the shoulder and elbow in both dominant and nondominant arms consisted of photographic record of the position-matching test, with goniometric measurement. SETTINGS: Physiotherapy department at the Birmingham Royal Ballet and School of Health Science, University of Birmingham. SUBJECTS: Two subject groups: physiotherapy students (n = 10), professional ballet dancers (n = 10). RESULTS: A mixed design analysis of variance found significant differences between the accuracy in position-matching at both the shoulder and elbow joints in the two groups (p < 0.05), with the ballet dancers having greater accuracy then the physiotherapy students. A significant difference in the joint positions tested were demonstrated (p < 0.05) with the positions of abduction
at the shoulder and extension of the elbow showing greatest accuracy in matching. There was no significant difference found between the dominant and nondominant upper limb in position-matching. CONCLUSION: Professional ballet dancers demonstrated greater accuracy in position-matching the upper limb, implying that mass and continuing practice can improve a motor sensory skill.},

Beyond a critical frequency the originally prepared out-of-phase, antisymmetric mode is replaced by a symmetrical, in-phase mode involving simultaneous activation of homologous muscle groups. Qualitatively, these phase transitions are analogous to gait shifts in animal locomotion as well as phenomena common to other physical and biological systems in which new "modes" or spatiotemporal patterns arise when the system is parametrically scaled beyond its equilibrium state (Haken, 1983). In this paper a theoretical model, using concepts central to the interdisciplinary field of synergetics and nonlinear oscillator theory, is developed, which reproduces (among other features) the dramatic change in coordinative pattern observed between the hands.},

In the case of delay coordinates this translates into finding the optimal delay time and embedding dimension from the absolute minimum of the advocated cost function. Its definition is based on theoretical arguments on noise amplification, the complexity of the reconstructed attractor, and a direct measure of local stretch which constitutes an irrelevance measure. The proposed method is demonstrated on synthetic and experimental time series.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel gait recognition method which uses the signals measured by a single inertial sensor located on the waist. This method considers human gait as a dynamical system and employs a few singular values obtained by means of Singular Spectrum Analysis applied to scalar measurements from the inertial sensor. Singular values can be interpreted as the approximate edge length of the bounding box wrapping the attractor in the latent space. Effects of different parameters on the gait recognition performance using patterns from 20 different subjects are analysed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
